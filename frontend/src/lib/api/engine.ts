        trap_followup: "TRAP FOLLOW-UP: Why doesn't adding more Uvicorn workers completely solve this issue when scaling under 10k req/s?",
        model_answer: "In FastAPI, `async def` endpoints execute directly on the main event loop thread. If a blocking synchronous operation runs there, it freezes the entire event loop, preventing all concurrent coroutines from progressing. To handle sync calls safely, use `def` (which FastAPI offloads to an internal thread pool) or use `asyncio.to_thread()`. Uvicorn workers each have their own single event loop, so worker saturation will still occur linearly.",

        trap_followup: "TRAP FOLLOW-UP: What happens if a mounted volume has root-owned permissions when your container starts as non-root UID 1001?",
        model_answer: "We use a multi-stage Docker build: Stage 1 (builder) uses `python:3.11-slim` with build-essential to compile wheels into `/root/.local`. Stage 2 (runtime) copies only the pre-compiled `/root/.local` into the runner stage, creates a dedicated non-root user (`useradd -u 1001 appuser`), and invokes `USER 1001`. For volumes, directory permissions must be pre-chowned in the Dockerfile before the USER directive.",

        model_answer: "When deleting a parent row referenced by a foreign key without an index on the child table, PostgreSQL must perform a sequential scan on the child table to verify referential integrity. This acquires row-level share locks across thousands of child rows, colliding with concurrent updates and causing distributed transaction deadlocks. Adding a B-Tree index on the child foreign key column allows immediate index-lookup verification.",

        model_answer: "Use `SET resource_name my_random_value NX PX 30000`. The random value is critical so that when releasing, a Lua script verifies that the lock's value matches the holder's token before deleting. To prevent expiration during long tasks, a background watchdog heartbeat renews the TTL periodically (similar to the Redisson watchdog algorithm).",

        model_answer: "If processing exceeds `max.poll.interval.ms`, the consumer coordinator considers the worker dead, ejects it from the group, and triggers an 'eager rebalance' across all consumers. This halts consumption for all partitions. To decouple this, poll messages immediately on the main thread and dispatch the payloads to a worker threadpool queue, pausing partition consumption via `consumer.pause()` if queue thresholds are reached.",
